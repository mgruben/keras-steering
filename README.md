# keras-steering
Train a neural net to learn the correct steering angle from visual input.

## Background
This project was completed for the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

If you're in that nanodegree or a related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
